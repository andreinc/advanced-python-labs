# Exercise 12-1 (gpresinfo.py, ui_gpresinfo.py, gpresinfo.ui)


Using the Qt designer, write a GUI application to display data from the presidentsqlite or presidentmysql module. It should have at least the following components:

 * A text field (use Entry) for entering the term number

 * A Search button for retrieving data

 * An Exit button

A widget or widgets to display the president’s information – you could use a Text widget, multiple Labels, or whatever suits your fancy.

Be creative.

For the ambitious Provide a combo box of all available presidents rather than making the user type in the name manually.

For the even more ambitious Implement a search function – let a user type text in a blank, and return a list of presidents which matches the text in either the first name or last name field. E.g., "jeff" would retrieve "Jefferson, Thomas", and "John" would retrieve "Adams, John", as well as "Kennedy, John", "Johnson, Lyndon" and so forth.
