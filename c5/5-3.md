## Exercise 5-3 (pres_gen.py)

Write a generator function to provide a sequence of the names of presidents (in "FIRSTNAME MIDDLENAME LASTNAME" format) from the presidents.txt file. They should be provided in the same order they are in the file. You should not read the entire file into memory, but one-at-a-time from the file.

Then iterate over the the generator returned by your function and print the names.
