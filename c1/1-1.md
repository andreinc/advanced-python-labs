# Exercise 1-1


Using the file presidents.txt (in the DATA folder), count the number of Presidents who were born in each state. In other words, the output of your script should be a list, sorted by state name, with the state and the number of presidents that were born in that state:


## Files

 * `pres_by_state.py`
 * `pres_by_states_sorted.py`

## TIP

First declare a dictionary to hold the data. Then read the file in one line at a time. Split each line into fields using a colon as the separator. Add/update the element of the dictionary where the key is the state. Add 1 each time the state occurs.

### Expected Output


```text
Arkansas 1
California 1
Connecticut 1
Georgia 1
etc
```
