# Exercise 2-1 

List each component of your PATH environment variable, together with the number of files it contains. This is the set of files you can execute from the command line without specifying a their path. Output should look something like this (for Windows, the paths will look different, but the idea is the same):

```text
/usr/bin 2376
/usr/local/bin 17
/usr/local/sbin  1
/usr/sbin 263
```

Use os to get the pathsep value; then use os.listdir to get the contents of each directory after splitting PATH.
