# Exercise 17-1 (count_ext.py)

Write a script which will count the number of files with each extension
in a file tree.  It should take the initial directory as a command line 
argument, and then display the total number of files with each distinct
file extension found.  Files with no extension should be skipped.
Use a `Counter` object to do the counting


## TIPs

 * Use `os.walk()` to walk the file tree
 * use `os.path.splitext()` to split the filename into a `(path,extension)` tuple.
