# Exercise 14_2: (folder_scanner.py)

Write a program that takes in a directory name on the command line, then traverses all files in that tree and prints a count of the following:

 * how many total files
 * how many total lines (count `\n`)
 * how many total bytes (`len()` of file contents)

HINT: use either a thread or process pool in combination with `os.walk()`.
