# Expercise 16-1 (xwords.py)

Using ElementTree, create a new XML file containing all the words that start with `x` from `words.txt`.


The root tag should be 'words', and each word should be contained in a 'word' tag. The finished file
should look like this:

```xml
<words>
   <word>xanthan</word>
   <word>xanthans</word>
   and so forth...
</words>
```
