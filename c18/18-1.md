# Exercise 18-1 (grep_sed.py)

Write type hints for the following code: rewriting the code if necessary:

```python
def grep(x):
   ```Only emits lines of text that contain x'''
   while True:
      coll = yield
      if x in coll:
          yield x

def sed(pattern, replacement):
   ```replace any lines containing pattern with replacement'''
   while True:
      value = yield
      if pattern in value:
	  yield replacement
    

```
