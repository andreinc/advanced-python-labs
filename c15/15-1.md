# Exercse 15-1 (copy_files.py)

Write a script to find all text files (only files ending in .txt) in the [DATA folder](../DATA) of your student files, and 
then copy them to `C:\TEMP` (Windows) or `/tmp` (non-windows). On Windows, create the TEMP folder if not already existing.

Add logging to the script, and log each file name as INFO.

## TIP

Use `shutil.copy()` to copy the files
