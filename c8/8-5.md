## Exercise 8-5 (word_actions.py)

Write a decorator, implemented as a class, to register functions that will process a list of words. The decorated functions will take one parameter — a string — and return the modified string.

The decorator itself takes two parameters — minimum length and maximum length. The class will store the min/max lengths as the key, and the functions as values, as class data.

The class will also provide a method named process_words, which will open DATA/words.txt and read it line by line. Each line contains a word.

For every registered function, if the length of the current word is within the min/max lengths, call all the functions whose key is that min/max pair.

In other words, if the registry key is (5, 8), and the value is [func1, func2], when the current word is within range, call func1(w) and func2(w), where w is the current word.

Example of class usage:

```python
word_select = WordSelect() # create callable instance 
@word_select(16, 18) # register function for length 16-18, inclusive 
def make_upper(s):
  return s.upper() 

word_select.process_words() # loop over words, call functions if selected
```

Suggested functions to decorate:

 * make the word upper-case

 * put stars before or around the word

 * reverse the word

Remember all the decorated functions take one argument, which is one of the strings in the word list, and return the modified word.
