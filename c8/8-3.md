# Exercise 8-3 (sillystring.py)

Without using the `class` statement, create a class named `SillyString`, which is initialized with any string. Include an instance method called every_other which returns every other character of the string.

Instantiate your string and print the result of calling the every_other() method. Your test code should look like this:

```python
ss = SillyString('this is a test') print(ss.every_other())
```

It should output

```text
ti sats
```
