# Exercise 13-2 (wiki_links_requests.py, wiki_links_urllib.py)

Write a script to count how many links are on the home page of wikipedia. To do this, read the page into memory and count instances of `href`.  For real 
screen-scraping, you can use the BeautifulSoup package.

You can use the string method `.find()` which can be called like `s.find('href', start, stop)`, which finds a slice of a string, moving forward each
time the string is found
