# Exercise 11-1 (president_sqlite.py)

For this exercise, you can use the SQLite3 database provided, or use your own DBMS. The mkpres.sql script is generic and should work with any DBMS to create and populate the presidents table. The SQLite3 database is named presidents.db and is located in the DATA folder of the student files.

The data has the following layout

| Field Name | Data Type   | Null | Default |
|------------|-------------|------|---------|
| termnum    | int(11)     | YES  | NULL    |
| lastname   | varchar(32) | YES  | NULL    |
| firstname  | varchar(64) | YES  | NULL    |
| termstart  | DATE        | YES  | NULL    |
| termend    | DATE        | YES  | NULL    |
| birthplace | varchar(128) | YES  | NULL    |
| birthstate | varchar(32) | YES  | NULL    |
| birthdate  | DATE        | YES  | NULL    |
| deathdate  | DATE        | YES  | NULL    |
| party      | varchar(32) | YES  | NULL    |

Refactor the president.py module to get its data from this table, rather than from a file. Re-run your previous scripts that used president.py; now they should get their data from the database, rather than from the flat file.

## Notes 

If you created a president.py module as part of an earlier lab, use that. Otherwise, use the supplied president.py module in the top folder of the student files.
