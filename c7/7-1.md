# Exercise 7-1 (president.py, president_main.py)

Create a module that implements a President class. This class has a constructor that takes the index number of the president (1-45) and creates an object containing the associated information from the presidents.txt file.

Provide the following properties (types indicated after ->):

term_number -> int 
first_name -> string 
last_name -> string 
birth_date -> date object 
death_date -> date object (or None, if still alive) 
birth_place -> string 
birth_state -> string 
term_start_date -> date object 
term_end_date -> date object (or None, if still in office) 
party -> string

Write a main script to exercise some or all of the properties. It could look something like:

```python
from president import President

p = President(1) # George Washington 
print("George was born at {0}, {1} on {2}".format( p.birth_place, p.birth_state, p.birth_date )
```
