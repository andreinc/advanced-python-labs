# Exercise 10-1 (test_president_pytest.py)

Using pytest, Create some unit tests for the President class you created earlier.

Suggestions for tests:

 * What happens when an out-of-range term number is given?

 * President 1â€™s first name is "George"

 * All 45 presidential terms match the correct last name (use list of last names and parametrize)

 * Confirm date fields return an object of type datetime.date

## Notes

If there was not an exercise where you created a President class, you can use president.py in the top-level folder of the student guide.
