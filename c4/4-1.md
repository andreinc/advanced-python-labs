# Exercise 4-1 (demystify.py)

Write a program that prints out every third byte (starting with the first byte) of the file named mystery. The output will be an ASCII art picture.

## TIP

read the file into a bytes object (be sure to use binary mode), then use slice notation to select the bytes, then decode into a string for printing.
