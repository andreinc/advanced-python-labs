# Exercise 6-1 (potus.py, potus_main.py)

Create a module named potus (`potus.py`) to provide information from the `presidents.txt` file. It should provide the following function:

`get_info(term#) -> dict #provide dictionary of info for a specified president`

Write a script to use the module.

For the ambitious (`potus_amb.py`, `potus_amb_main.py`)

Add the following functions to the module

```text
get_oldest() -> string # return the name of oldest president
get_youngest()-> string # return the name of youngest president
```

'youngest' and 'oldest' refer to age at beginning of first term and age at end of last term.
